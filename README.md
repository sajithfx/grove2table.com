**Orange County's Hyperlocal Food Platform**

From California groves and local farms to your neighborhood table.

## About

Grove2Table is a platform that connects Orange County residents with ultra-fresh produce from local farms and farmers markets. We work WITH farmers markets, not around them, to drive more customers to vendor booths while making fresh, local food more accessible.

## How It Works

1. **Browse & Order** - Browse available produce by market day, place orders 48+ hours ahead
2. **Visit the Market** - Go to your chosen farmers market on market day
3. **Pick Up & Pay** - Collect pre-ordered items at vendor booths, pay market prices directly
